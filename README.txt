*\ Introduction /*
Welcome to who wants to be a millionaire. A game where each question you get right in a row increases the money prize you can get (monopoly money in this case of course).
Of course, it's not just endless trivia question. We feature:
- Lifelines to save you from a particularly hard question
- Cameos from Miku, Gman, some random turtle dude, and a woman [not really. It's just one of the devs badly imitating them and using AI, and Miku being text to speech]
- Music which are definitely not ours
- Endless fun with randomized options and questions [not really endless]
